# Plan: Chalkline version 1

The next stage, toward a first version. Three pieces of work, in this order: **a new intro deck**, **a template deck** inside Chalkline, and **an updated sample unit** built from the templates. Written 2026-10-29; update the status lines as the work moves.

## The message

What every piece of version 1 should say, in this order:

1. **Lists first.** Your course's key facts and vocabulary, kept as lists, are the most reusable thing you own. Once a list exists, it becomes cards, glosses, games, quizzes and printables in minutes. (See "lists are the secret" in `IDEAS.md`.)
2. **Reusable elements.** Slides, pages and printables are built from a few plain, named pieces (boxes, tiles, steps, timers, vocab cards, packet galleries), not drawn one by one.
3. **Chalkline keeps everything in order.** One folder per unit; slides, worksheets, packets, vocab and two websites all come from the same files, and stay in step.
4. **Your course is vibe-codable.** The files are plain text that a teacher (or an AI assistant) can read and change in plain words.

**AI can support the process, but this project is about legibility, consistency and teacher control.** The teacher can always read the source, see why something looks the way it does, and change it. Every design choice in version 1 should pass that test.

## 1. The new intro deck

**Status:** to do. Replaces `course/units/00-start-here/slides.qmd` (keep its good slides; see "Reuse" below).

**Where it lives:** only on the project page (this repository's site). It's sample content, so `.quartoignore` already keeps it out of a teacher's new course.

**How it's told:** features one at a time, from a teacher's point of view: what a teacher does on an ordinary day, then what Chalkline does for them. One feature per slide where possible, each with a live example and one line on how to write it.

### Part A: Your materials, in one place

| # | Slide | Shows | Reuse / build |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Your materials are all kept in one place | One folder per unit: slides, worksheets, pictures, vocab | "The usual way" and "The Chalkline way" slides |
| A2 | How slides are written | A slide is text you can read: the source beside the result | "A slide is just text you can read" |
| A3 | Everything is searchable | The site's search finding a word across units | New: a screenshot or live search |
| A4 | The tools | The classroom toolbox (W): clock, stopwatch, voice level, traffic light, scoreboard, name picker, groups, dice, QR code, spotlight, whiteboard… and the slide timer | "Classroom tools in every deck" |
| A5 | The vocab sidebar | Opening the Vocab sidebar during a lesson | New example slide |
| A6 | Vocab glossing | `{{< vocab "democracy" >}}`: a pop-up with picture and 中文 | "Vocabulary support, built in" |
| A7 | Vocab you can drop in: the gallery | `{{< vocab-cards unit=1 words="…" >}}` on a slide | Existing shortcode |
| A8 | The packet sidebar | Opening the Packet sidebar during a lesson | New example slide |
| A9 | Packet pages you can drop in: the gallery | `{{< pdf-viewer "…-packet.pdf" layout="gallery" >}}` | Used in the Slide kit and City-States decks |
| A10 | Bilingual slides (optional) | The language controls, boxed and explained | The Slide kit's "This slide is bilingual" slide |
| A11 | Pre-built templates | A few classroom-activity slides from the template deck (section 2) | Links to the template deck |
| A12 | Your course can be themed | The same slide in a few colour schemes and looks | Slide kit's schemes; "It always looks like your school" |

### Part B: One process, many outputs

| # | Slide | Shows | Reuse / build |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Packets are made by the same process | A unit's worksheets become one printed packet | "Packets build themselves" |
| B2 | Student and teacher versions | One file, two editions: answer keys and notes only for the teacher (`content-visible when-profile="teacher"`) | "Two websites from the same files" |
| B3 | An optional parent site | The same materials for families (`audience: [parent]`, `families.qmd`) | "Two websites from the same files"; see the open question below |

### Part C: Vocab and play

| # | Slide | Shows | Reuse / build |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | How vocab is stored | One list (`vocab/data/vocab.csv`): a row per word, checked by `python chalkline.py validate` | New; the "lists first" message lands here |
| C2 | The vocab site | The vocab app: every word with its picture and 中文, searchable | New screenshot slide |
| C3 | Interactive activities on slides | Polls, timelines, Label it, sort it | "Try a poll", "So what else can you do?" |
| C4 | Whiteboard games | Snowman, matching, Jeopardy, quick-fire… from the vocab list | Existing games |
| C5 | Games at home | The "Play at home" page (`course/play.qmd`) | New slide |

### Part D: Get started

| # | Slide | Shows | Reuse / build |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Getting started, on one page | The one-page instructions: from an empty computer to your own course | `quick-start.qmd`; "Get your own copy" |
| D2 | The message | The four points above, and "AI supports, you stay in control" | New closing slide |

Then the usual credits slide (`CLAUDE.md`: two columns, pictures and sources).

### Reuse from the current deck

Keep or adapt: "A slide is just text you can read", "Packets build themselves", "Vocabulary support, built in", "Two websites from the same files", "Classroom tools in every deck", "Try a poll", "It always looks like your school", "Get your own copy". Move elsewhere: "How this sample is organized" and "Make your own unit" (to the Chalkline guide, section 2); "Editing with an AI assistant" becomes part of the closing message. Drop: the Athens and Sparta example slide (the template deck shows layouts better).

## 2. The template deck

**Status:** to do. Starts from the Slide kit deck (`course/units/00-start-here/slide-kit-slides.qmd`), which already has most of the activity slides.

**Where it lives:** inside the Chalkline extension, as a reference that every course gets and that updates with Chalkline. It's shown in **a new section of the teacher site: "How to use Chalkline"**, separate from the intro deck.

### What's in it

**Classroom activity templates, all bilingual.** Each one is a ready-to-copy slide with speaker notes that name its pieces:

- Lesson intro + Do now (topic, objective, homework, focus vocab, sentence frames, timer)
- Instructions with a video and a work gallery
- Think-Pair-Share (steps, seating, two timers)
- Easy to hard: chained challenges on one project
- Jigsaw: expert groups as puzzle pieces, with the steps and timers
- Group task, speaking frames, reveal table, cards, big idea, source / meaning / takeaway
- Lesson summary diagram (draw.io)
- Section opener, exit ticket, credits

**Bilingual examples for other kinds of slide**, clearly marked optional: the language controls slide, plus a few non-activity slides in both languages and in English only.

**Reusable resources** (a few pages at the end):

- **Lesson phase tags:** bilingual pills for each phase (Do now, Learn, Practice, Discuss, Reflect, Exit ticket…), ready to copy.
- **Colour sets:** the colour schemes, side by side, with what each is for.
- **Style:** the looks (game, brutal, scroll, dusk…) and when to use them.
- **Brand assets:** logos, fonts and colours from `brand/`, and how to change them.
- **Design guidance** (to be written): short rules for people and for AI assistants to read before making new slides, focused on **high-quality slides that work for translanguaging**: one idea per slide, short sentences, room for a second language, pictures that carry meaning, contrast, consistent places for the same things. To be added to `CLAUDE.md` once agreed.

### How it ships (to work out)

- **Source:** move the deck and its files into the extension (for example `_extensions/chalkline/guide/`), with its own pictures and `CREDITS.md`.
- **Rendering:** a course's site renders only `course/**` and a few pages, so the extension's deck needs a way in: a render entry in the project type, or `chalkline.py` copying it into the site at build time. Pick the one that keeps a teacher's course free of files they didn't write.
- **The deck's own CSS** (looks, the puzzle layout, the style picker): decide which parts become Chalkline pieces (`styles/`) and which stay examples. Candidates for Chalkline: the puzzle layout, the draw.io hover script (now copied per unit), lesson phase tags.
- **Pictures:** keep them small, openly licensed and credited inside the extension.

## 3. An updated sample unit

**Status:** after sections 1 and 2.

A unit rebuilt from the templates, to show a real unit made the version 1 way: **lists first** (its vocab and key facts in `vocab/data/vocab.csv` and a facts list), then slides from the templates, a packet, glossing, games and the parent view. The Hundred Schools of Thought material (thinkers, pictures, credits) is a ready start; it has no vocab yet, which makes it a good demonstration of starting from the list.

## Order of work

1. Agree on this plan, the design guidance's scope and the open questions.
2. Template deck: move the Slide kit into the extension, add the reusable-resources pages, and add the "How to use Chalkline" section of the teacher site.
3. Intro deck: rebuild in the order above, reusing slides and linking to the template deck.
4. Updated sample unit.
5. Version 1: update `README.md`, the quick start, `CHANGELOG.md` and the release notes.

## Open questions

- **Parent site:** today families use the student site and its "For families" page. Is "a parent site" that page (and `audience: [parent]`), or a third build (`--profile parent`)?
- **Searchable:** Quarto's site search covers pages and slides on the website; is that enough, or should search also cover the vocab and the packets?
- **The template deck's home:** which render path (above), and should a course be able to hide or extend it?
- **Design guidance:** who writes the first draft, and does it also become checks (for example a lint for slides that are too full)?
- **The current Slide style experiment** (`slide-style-slides.qmd`): retire it once the template deck covers its ideas?
